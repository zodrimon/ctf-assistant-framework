### TASK-002 — Add dev tooling
**Date:** 2026-07-09
**What I built:** Added development tooling configurations for the project, including `pytest` for testing, `black` and `ruff` for code formatting and linting, and `pre-commit` to run these checks automatically before code is committed.
**Key concepts:** 
- **Linters/Formatters:** Tools like `black` and `ruff` automatically check for code style issues and format the code so it looks consistent across all files.
- **pre-commit:** A framework that runs checks automatically whenever you try to create a new `git commit`, preventing bad code from being saved to the history.
**How it fits together:** This tooling does not directly affect the engine or the CTF modules described in the architecture. Instead, it forms the foundation for writing the engine and modules cleanly, ensuring all future code follows the same standard.
**Files touched:** 
- `pyproject.toml`
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
